# DEAR

Discrete Events for Adaptive AUTOSAR (DEAR) is a framework that integrates the
reactor model [1] with the communication mechanisms of Adaptive AUTOSAR. This
allows to model deterministic distributed applications in Adaptive AUTOSAR. A description of the mechanisms used in DEAR can be found in our paper [2].

So far this is just a placeholder and the source code is not yet publicly
available. We will publish it in January 2020!
